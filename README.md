## Setup Discord Application

To use this application, you need to set up a Discord application:

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Copy the Application ID
4. Upload game icons to "Rich Presence ‚Üí Art Assets":
   - `gameloop-logo` - Main Gameloop logo
   - `pubg_mobile`, `cod_mobile`, etc. - Game-specific icons
   - `android` - Default icon for unknown apps

## Usage

1. **Start Discord** - Make sure Discord desktop app is running
2. **Start the monitor** - Run the executable or Python script
3. **Launch Gameloop** - Open Gameloop and start playing
4. **Check Discord** - Your status should automatically update

The application will:
- Detect when Gameloop starts/stops
- Show the current game you're playing
- Track your play time
- Switch to "Idle" after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Update automatically when you switch games

## Configuration

### Custom Games

To add support for custom games, edit the `games` dictionary in the script:

```python
self.games = {
    'com.your.custom.game': {
        'name': 'Your Game Name',
        'icon': 'your_game_icon'
    }
}
```

### Settings

- **Update Interval**: Change `self.update_interval = 10` (seconds)
- **Idle Threshold**: Change `self.idle_threshold = 300` (seconds)
- **Discord Client ID**: Change `CLIENT_ID` in main function

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect to Discord"
- Make sure Discord desktop app is running
- Restart Discord and try again

### "ADB not found" or "Device not found"
- Make sure Gameloop is fully loaded (not just starting)
- Make sure adb Debugging option is enabled from Gameloop settings
- Try restarting Gameloop
- The script auto-detects ADB from Gameloop installation

### Games not recognized
- Check if the game's package name is in the supported list
- Add custom games using the configuration method above

### Rich Presence not showing
- Make sure you've uploaded the required images to Discord Developer Portal
- Check that the image names match exactly (case-sensitive)
